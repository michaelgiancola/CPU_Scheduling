# CPU_Scheduling
Created a program that implements CPU Scheduling Algorithms. Algorithm speeds are evaluated through process-filled queues which are constructed by parsing input files describing scenarios of varying size/complexity. Results of the corresponding scheduled ready queue are then printed out.

## Scheduling Algorithms Implemented

* First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
* Round Robin (RR)
